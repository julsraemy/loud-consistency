# Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) Consistency

To do
- [ ] IIIF (X) vs Linked Art (Y), against Xs implementation how consistent? Against Ys implementation - maybe PIA deliverable?
- [ ] Syntax against the Linked Art Schema Definitions - Linked Art specification <-> Data [Automatable] - 1/24th records (LUX), the highest number of parallel processes: could https://github.com/linked-art/json-validator be leveraged?
- [ ] Unit to unit consistency, e.g. YCBA & YUAG to check (same domain) [To some extent, first by hand with a couple of instances, then Activity Streams endpoints or thumb drives]
- [ ] LUX <-> external Linked Art that have the same concepts, that would be the Getty JSON-LD representation of the AAT, ULAN, TGN [To some extent, first by hand with a couple of instances]
- [ ] Vocabulary consistency. LUX, [The Art and Life of Georgia Oâ€™Keefe](https://collections.okeeffemuseum.org/), Getty, [Rijksmuseum](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/download/) [Not automatable], for instance: `Primary Name`, `Exhibition`, `Material Statement`, `Provenance Statement`
